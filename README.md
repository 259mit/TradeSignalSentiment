# TradeSignalSentiment
The project aimed at creating a sentiment analyser for deriving trade signals using news articles and videos and hence developing a trading strategy using VADER score and MACD. Sometimes sentiments have been more influential in driving a stock up or down than any other factors pertaining to the fundamental or technical aspects of the stock. Hence we believe that at any point if we are able to gauge the sentiment of an asset in the market, we will be able to successfully trade that asset profitably.
